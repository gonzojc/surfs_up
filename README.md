# Surfs Up Challege

## Overview of Project

After completing a thorough analysis of weather data for your potential investor prior to opening a new surf ice cream shop in Hawaii, he requests additional follow-up analysis of temperature trends specifically for the months of June and December in Oahu. Your investor wants to ensure business will flourish throughout the year. 

### Results

  * According to the analysis, there is potential during the months of June and December for a 60 degree difference in temperature. While that difference is fairly drastic, there were some warm days in December with the max being 78 and an average in the low 70s. This could potentially serve as suitable surf and ice cream temperatures, even during the coldest month of December. 
  * The overall max for the month of June is significantly higher than December at 83 and high 70s for the average. June and the summer months weather are more than appropraiate for surfing and ice cream.
  * Even though there is a bit of a temperature difference between the winter and summer time in Oahu, the average temperatures for both of those times still make for good surf and ice cream weather, therefore, business year round should be more than sufficient.

## Summary

Based on the temperature analysis for the entire year in Oahu, the Surf and Shake shop should do very well and even remain fairly consistent in the winter time, likely when tourists from colder temperatures would be visiting. Additionally analysis on average rain fall and even wind might be a more in depth way to provide insight into what you and the investor can do to mitigate any slow season and determine a business plan to promote/market the shop during these times. The analysis could even be further dialed in by looking at heavy tourist seasons where you can heavily market the shop in order to negate any potential losses during the winter season.
